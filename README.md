LLM-Driven Article Analyzer

This project involves developing an LLM model to scrape information from websites and documents, focusing on financial articles. It aims to help financial analysts quickly and efficiently extract information, surpassing ChatGPT-3.5 by allowing direct file uploads and avoiding copy-pasting issues. The chatbot will have a built-in knowledge base to access and retrieve relevant information from all articles.

By leveraging FAISS for quick vector similarity searches and OpenAI embeddings for accurate text representation, this approach efficiently handles large sets of text data. Streamlit provides a user-friendly interface for inputting URLs and queries. Securely storing the OpenAI API key and processing data in manageable steps ensures security and efficiency. This method optimizes token limits and reduces costs by processing only relevant data chunks, making the application scalable and cost-effective.
